            <h1>Welcome to Cantara</h1>
            <p>Cantara is a Norwegian non-profit association, with a purpose to build and spread IT professional expertise by collecting, disseminating and sharing professional information, as well as arranging meetings, discussions and informal gatherings to create a community around professionalizing IT development.</p>
            
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p> The assosciation Cantara was established in 2014 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorhenninghetland/">Thor Henning "Totto" Hetland</a> to be a steward for the software development knowledge and tools that was part of the Objectware Community Wiki. This content was created and published over many years by the Norwegian IT-consulting company Objectware, where Totto had been a core champion for this work. However when Totto left the company in connection with a reorganization it no longer stayed a priority to further develop and curate this content, so to avoid the loss of this knowledge for the development community the entire knowledge base and all related tooling was open sourced and made available to be further curated by the development community at large.</p>
			<p>After Cantara took over stewardship of this content it was expanded greatly as part of a variety of commercial and public sector development projects, with the public GitHub repository now containing more than 150 open source repositories of various software packages and tooling. The self-hosted wiki based software process knowledge has unfortunatly been unavailable for some time due to security issues, but is expected to be made available again in the future when a conversion to a cloud based wiki can be completed.</p>

			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<p>Cantara currently has few regularly scheduled activites, but has traditionally in mid-november organized an annual meeting and christmas beer tasting in Oslo for active volunteers, board members and assosciated supporters.<br>
			Contact the active organizers on Slack to get information about current activities.</p>
